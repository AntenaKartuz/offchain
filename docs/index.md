# Getting started

Documentation for version: **v0.1.0**

## Overview

`offchain` is an open-source Python package for processing NFT metadata. Despite the name, it handles both offchain and onchain NFT metadata. `offchain` is maintained by Zora and used by the Zora Indexer and API. The goal of this project is to enable anyone to contribute a parser to standardize their custom NFT metadata schema. If you'd like to contribute your own metadata parsing implementation, please see the `Contributing` page.
