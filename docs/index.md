# Getting Started

Documentation for version: **v0.2.0**

## Overview

`offchain` is an open-source Python package that makes it easy to index both **onchain and offchain** NFT metadata.
Now anyone can define and standardize the indexing of custom NFT metadata schemas.

`offchain` powers the Zora Indexer, meaning any contributions to metadata parsing implementations will be reflected in the Zora API.
Check out the [`Contributing`](./contributing/guidelines.md) page to implement custom metadata.

Lastly, please review the [`Core Concepts`](./concepts.md) page before reading the rest of the documentation.

## Installation

with pip:

```bash
pip install offchain
```

with poetry:

```bash
poetry add offchain
```

from repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ourzora/offchain.git
